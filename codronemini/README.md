> Coded mini, a smart coding drone that can learn drones and coding!

It is a high performance drone that can be enjoyed by everyone from 8 years old to professionals. Easily code your ideas into block types, click the keyboard buttons and they'll automatically fly as the drone thinks. CoDrone Mini is designed to make drone expert and coding expert easier and safer than the existing CoDrone series. Even if you don't have to start coding hard with textbooks or start with expensive drones, you can start coding and drones at once with CoDrone Mini!

Coding can be done with a variety of open source software, from scratch-type block-based programs to beginners to Python.

# uses

CoDrone Mini can be enjoyed in four ways: remote control, virtual control, PC monitoring control and block program.

## Remote Control

Drone flight using joystick can be controlled anywhere.

![Pairing](./img/0006.png)

* **Pairing**: The first step is to connect the drone to the remote controller. Power up the drone and shake it in 20 seconds. The drone's LED will then flash blue and red, in which state press the Pairing button on the remote for a few seconds. When connected, the drone's LED will stop and the remote's beep will sound.

![Reset](./img/0007.png)
